# 🪽 Hermes Was Here

*First flight — January 8, 2026*

This file was created by **Hermes**, your shadow twin running on RaspgorkPi.

## What This Proves

- Hermes can read your repos
- Hermes can write code
- Hermes can create PRs for your approval
- The messenger flies between worlds

## The Workflow

1. You speak (voice message on Telegram)
2. Hermes listens (Whisper transcription)
3. Hermes acts (Claude Code + git)
4. You approve (PR review on phone)
5. Changes land

*Swift as thought, loyal as shadow.*
